# Big Data_Hadoop
PoC on using Hadoop for Big Data. Use of Sqoop, Pig, Hive and IBM Watson is demonstrated. 
I used Cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.12.0.0 loaded on an Oracle VM Virtual Box.
The dataset used is a self collected dataset consisting of records of 3000 patients across the country for a few select hospitals.
